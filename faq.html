<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The default TV Cast for AirPlay app will take the video playing on your iDevice to play on your TV. For example you want to mirror video content in full HD quality from youtube, you need to select 1080 quality mode.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.2px 0.0px; font: 15.2px 'Helvetica Neue'; color: #6d6d6d; -webkit-text-stroke: #6d6d6d"><span class="s1"><b>7) Some apps wonâ€™t Screen Mirror, how is that possible?</b><b></b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney+ and Apple TV have decided to block this. There is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Open that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.</span></p>
